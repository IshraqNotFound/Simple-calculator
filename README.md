## Simple-calculator
This is my first repository. I made this with C# .NET Console App. Using **Visual Studio**.


## Introduction
Hi, I am **Muhammad Ishraq Hasin**, but you can call me **Ishraq**. I am a student of **BAF Shaheen College Kurmitola** and I have a dream of becoming a pilot or a programmer. I was born in ***2009*** and I have been learning programming since ***2017***. I joined **GitHub** in **December 2023** and I have been working on various projects related to **web development, data science, and machine learning**. I love coding and solving real-world problems with my skills and creativity. I chose to study at BAF Shaheen College Kurmitola because I wanted to join the Bangladesh Air Force as a pilot. I am proud of making a game in Unity and a website with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I enjoy reading science fiction books, playing football, and video games such as Minecraft, PUBG, and GTA. I also like watching movies that teach me about black holes and physics, such as Interstellar. My goal is to make my parents proud and become a successful pilot or programmer in the future.
